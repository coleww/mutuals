:fist: a blockbot for twitter






### TODO

- setup this magic
- on heroku scheduler, get recent notifications, and then:
- for anyone who u do not follow, if they interacted with u, and aren't a new follower in "THE MAGIC ZONE", block them.
- "the magic zone" AKA when someone follows you, you will have TIME_SPAN to follow them back before the bot soft-blocks them.
- the bot will also auto-block accounts that follow u that match certain v specific bot/harasser/asshole indicators.
- some sort of UI to see a log of what the bot did
- use env vars for settings
